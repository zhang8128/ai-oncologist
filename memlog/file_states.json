The DNAJ-PKAc fusion kinase is a defining feature of fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC). FLC tumors are notoriously resistant to standard chemotherapies, with aberrant kinase activity assumed to be a contributing factor. By combining proximity proteomics, biochemical analyses, and live-cell photoactivation microscopy, we demonstrate that DNAJ-PKAc is not constrained by A-kinase anchoring proteins. Consequently, the fusion kinase phosphorylates a unique array of substrates, including proteins involved in translation and the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2-associated athanogene 2 (BAG2), a co-chaperone recruited to the fusion kinase through association with Hsp70. Tissue samples from patients with FLC exhibit increased levels of BAG2 in primary and metastatic tumors. Furthermore, drug studies implicate the DNAJ-PKAc/Hsp70/BAG2 axis in potentiating chemotherapeutic resistance. We find that the Bcl-2 inhibitor navitoclax enhances sensitivity to etoposide-induced apoptosis in cells expressing DNAJ-PKAc. Thus, our work indicates BAG2 as a marker for advanced FLC and a chemotherapeutic resistance factor in DNAJ-PKAc signaling scaffolds. Lauer et al. define molecular mechanisms of chemotherapeutic resistance that impede treatment of the adolescent liver cancer fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC). Their studies implicate the athanogene BAG2 as a marker for advanced FLC and a chemotherapeutic resistance factor in DNAJ-PKAc fusion kinase signaling scaffolds. Rare tumors represent approximately 20% of total cancer incidence.1 Gene fusions that involve protein kinases represent a broad class of oncogenes that drive a diverse se\n",

Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a rare primary hepatic cancer that develops in children and young adults without cirrhosis. Little is known about its pathogenesis, and it can only be treated with surgery. We performed an integrative genomic analysis of a large series of patients with FLC to identify associated genetic factors. Using 78 clinically annotated FLC samples, we performed whole-transcriptome (n=58), single-nucleotide polymorphism array (n=41), and next-generation sequencing (n=48) analyses; we also assessed the prevalence of the DNAJB1\u2013PRKACA fusion transcript associated with this cancer (n=73). We performed class discovery using non-negative matrix factorization, and functional annotation using gene set enrichment analyses, nearest template prediction, ingenuity pathway analyses, and immunohistochemistry. The genomic identification of significant targets in cancer algorithm was used to identify chromosomal aberrations, MuTect and VarScan2 were used to identify somatic mutations, and the random survival forest was used to determine patient prognoses. Findings were validated in an independent cohort. Unsupervised gene expression clustering revealed 3 robust molecular classes of tumors: the proliferation class (51% of samples) had altered expression of genes that regulate proliferation and mTOR signaling activation; the inflammation class (26% of samples) had altered expression of genes that regulate inflammation and cytokine production; and the unannotated class (23% of samples) had a gene expression signature not previously associated with liver tumors. Expression of genes that regulate neuroendocrine function, as well has histologic markers of cholangiocytes and hepatocytes, were detected in all 3 classes. FLCs had few copy number variations; the most frequent were focal amplification at 8q24.3 (in 12.5% of samples) and deletions at 19p13 (in 28% of samples) and 22q13.32 (in 25% of samples). The DNAJB1\u2013PRKACA fusion transcript was detected in 79% of samples.

A novel DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion gene characterizes almost all cases, distinguishes it from other hepatocellular neoplasms, and drives the pathogenesis of this unique tumor. A subset of cases of fibrolamellar carcinoma is associated with alternate mechanisms of protein kinase A activation. This review article discusses common and unusual histologic features of fibrolamellar carcinoma, its differential diagnoses, and how to make the diagnosis while avoiding key pitfalls.

Here, we use chromatin run-on sequencing to discover \u223c7,000 enhancers and 141 enhancer hotspots activated in FLC relative to nonmalignant liver. Bioinformatic analyses reveal aberrant ERK/MEK signaling and candidate master transcriptional regulators. We also define the genes most strongly associated with hotspots of FLC enhancer activity, including CA12 and SLC16A14.

            "Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare liver tumor driven by the DNAJ-PKAc fusion protein that affects healthy young patients. Little is known about the immune response to FLC, limiting rational design of immunotherapy. Multiplex immunohistochemistry and gene expression profiling were performed to characterize the FLC tumor immune microenvironment and adjacent non-tumor liver (NTL). Flow cytometry and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing were performed to determine the phenotype of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and the extent of T cell clonal expansion. Fresh human FLC tumor slice cultures (TSCs) were treated with antibodies blocking programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), with results measured by cleaved caspase-3 immunohistochemistry. Immune cells were concentrated in fibrous stromal bands, rather than in the carcinoma cell compartment. In FLC, T cells demonstrated decreased activation and regulatory T cells in FLC had more frequent expression of PD-1 and CTLA-4 than in NTL. Furthermore, T cells had relatively low levels of clonal expansion despite high TCR conservation across individuals. Combination PD-1 and IL-10 blockade signficantly increased cell death in human FLC TSCs. Immunosuppresion in the FLC tumor microenvironment is characterized by T cell exclusion and exhaustion, which may be reversible with combination immunotherapy. Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare form of liver cancer that primarily occurs in otherwise healthy adolescents and young adults1,2. Patients with FLC often present with late stage disease that is not amenable to curative resection and rarely responds to chemotherapy3,4. Consequently, five-year recurrence free survival (RFS) for patients with FLC is lower than for those with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) despite a significantly healthier patient population5,6,7. The vast majority of FLC tumors harbor a characteristic chromosome 19 somatic microdeletion that creates a conserved fusion gene between part of the chaperone DnaJ heat shock protein 40 member B1 (DNAJB1) and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PRKACA)8,9,10. The resultant DNAJ-PKAc fusion protein, but not PRKACA over-expression, is sufficient to induce tumors that resemble FLC in mice and is thought to play an important role in human FLC oncogenesis, potentially through recruitment of heat shock protein 70 and subsequent activatio\n",

            "Cancer is a medical condition which has a molecular basis. Proto-oncogenes are the first regulatory factors of this biological process. They act in transmitting signals, resulting as growth factors. Modifications of these genes, called oncogenes, lead to the appearance of cancer cells. The activation process leading to proto-oncogenes are chromosomal translocation, point mutation, and gene amplification. Concerning the clonal theory of oncogenesis, it is believed that a tumor starts from a cell. Furthermore, there is close association between tumor development and inhibition of apoptosis or programmed cell death, providing cell immortality. Angiogenesis and angiogenic factors found to be expressed in tumors and may play a key role in tumor formation and development. Tumor-suppressor genes block the growth of cancer and contribute to the normal development of cells. This article highlights the evidence that neoplasms develop as the after-effect of the increase of acquired and physical genetic variations in proto-oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes; these form a target group in the cells of neoplasms. Tumor formation and development are characterized by individual processes, working synergistically, and an understanding of each individual process may provide a better basis for further anticancer research.

Keywords: Epigenetic modifications, Cancer heterogeneity, Drug resistance, DNA methylation, Histone modifications, Chromatin remodeling, Epigenetic therapies, Gene expression regulation Cancer heterogeneity and drug resistance remain pivotal obstacles in effective cancer treatment and management. One major contributor to these challenges is epigenetic modifications - gene regulation that does not involve changes to the DNA sequence itself but significantly impacts gene expression. As we elucidate these phenomena, we underscore the pivotal role of epigenetic modifications in regulating gene expression, contributing to cellular diversity, and driving adaptive changes that can instigate therapeutic resistance. This review dissects essential epigenetic modifications - DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling - illustrating their significant yet complex contributions to cancer biology. While these changes offer potential avenues for therapeutic intervention due to their reversible nature, the interplay of epigenetic and genetic changes in cancer cells presents unique challenges that must be addressed to harness their full potential. By critically analyzing the current research landscape, we identify knowledge gaps and propose future research directions, exploring the potential of epigenetic therapies and discussing the obstacles in translating these concepts into effective treatments.

            "Corresponding author. Issue date 2013 Oct. Epigenetic mechanisms provide an adaptive layer of control in the regulation of gene expression that enables an organism to adjust to a changing environment. Epigenetic regulation increases the functional complexity of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by altering chromatin structure, nuclear organization, and transcript stability. These changes may additively or synergistically influence gene expression and result in long-term molecular and functional consequences independent of the DNA sequence that may ultimately define an individual\u2019s phenotype. This paper (1) describes histone modification, DNA methylation, and expression of small noncoding ribonucleic acid (RNA) species; (2) reviews the most common methods used to measure these epigenetic changes; and (3) presents factors that need to be considered when choosing a specific tissue to evaluate for epigenetic changes. Keywords: epigenetics, DNA methylation, histone modification, small untranslated RNA The consensus sequence of the human genome was published 10 years ago, and information on variation within disease susceptibility genes has increased. Genome search methods (e.g., candidate gene association studies, family-based studies, genome-wide association studies) have uncovered many genetic variants associated with a trait or disease phenotype. However, for any given study, any combination of these variants accounts for only a relatively small proportion of the total phenotypic variance observed in a sample. Therefore, alternative sources of phenotypic variation in heritable traits must exist. Epigenetics (epi meaning above; that is, above the level of the DNA) is defined as changes in phenotype or gene expression caused by a mechanism other than alterations in the underlying DNA sequence (Berger, Kouzarides, Shiekhattar, & Shilatifard, 2009). These changes may remain for the duration of the cell\u2019s life, persist through cell division, and be transmitted in a specific cell lineage for multiple generations. Epigenetics provides an adaptive layer of control in the regulation of gene expression to enable the organism to adjust to a changing environment. This additional layer of control is influenced by developmental stage, tissue type, environmental conditions, and disease status of the individual (De Bustos et al., 2009; Keshet et al., 2006; Mikkelsen et al., 2007).

            "Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare but fatal cancer that occurs primarily in young people. There are currently no known effective treatments, although several promising treatments appear to be in development. Genetic studies have confirmed that almost all FLC tumors have a fusion protein marker (DNAJB1-PRKACA) encoded by a fusion gene (DNAJB1-PRKACA); It is currently accepted as a diagnostic criterion for FLCs. Several research teams have established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) FLC models using immunocompromised animals as hosts and patient tissue samples (tumors or ascites) as primary sources for PDX-derived organoids. These FLC organoids are composed of FLC epithelia, endothelial progenitor cells, and stellate cells. CRISPR/Cas9 was used as a gene editing technique to modify mature hepatocytes to obtain ex vivo FLC-like cells expressing the fusion gene and/or other mutated genes associated with FLCs. Although these models simulate some but not all FLC features. Drug screening using these models has not proven effective in identifying clinically useful treatments. Genetic studies comparing FLCs to normal maturing endodermal cell lineages have shown that FLCs share genetic signatures not with hepatocytes, but with subpopulations of biliary tree stem cells (BTSCs), hepato/pancreatic stem/progenitor cells that consistently reside in peribiliary glands (PBGs) located in the biliary tree and are sources of stem cells for the formation and postnatal regeneration of the liver and pancreas. Therefore, it is expected that models of BTSCs, instead of hepatocytes may prove more useful. In this review, we summarize the status of the various FLC models and their features, applications, and limitations. They provide opportunities to understand the cause and characteristics of this deadly disease and are models from which effective treatments can be identified. Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is named for its unique histological features, particularly the large amount of early lineage stage mesenchymal cells, which are precursors to endothelia and stellate cells, associated with FLC tumor cells (1\u20134). In contrast to patients with conventional hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), patients with FLC typically have no clinical history of liver cirrhosis; few have hepatitis virus infections; and they are routinely negative for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), an indicator of other l\n",

            "Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a lethal primary liver cancer, affecting young patients in absence of chronic liver disease. Molecular understanding of FLC tumorigenesis is limited, partly due to the scarcity of experimental models. Here, we CRISPR-engineer human hepatocyte organoids to recreate different FLC backgrounds, including the predominant genetic alteration, the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion, as well as a recently reported background of FLC-like tumors, encompassing inactivating mutations of BAP1 and PRKAR2A. Phenotypic characterizations and comparisons with primary FLC tumor samples revealed mutant organoid-tumor similarities. All FLC mutations caused hepatocyte dedifferentiation, yet only combined loss of BAP1 and PRKAR2A resulted in hepatocyte transdifferentiation into liver ductal/progenitor-like cells that could exclusively grow in a ductal cell environment. BAP1-mutant hepatocytes represent primed cells attempting to proliferate in this cAMP-stimulating environment, but require concomitant PRKAR2A loss to overcome cell cycle arrest. In all analyses, DNAJB1-PRKACAfus organoids presented with milder phenotypes, suggesting differences between FLC genetic backgrounds, or for example the need for additional mutations, interactions with niche cells, or a different cell-of-origin. These engineered human organoid models facilitate the study of FLC. Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare, lethal primary liver cancer. Effective therapies for FLC remain elusive, as FLC tumors infrequently respond to both chemotherapy and targeted therapies approved for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), highlighting its distinct biology1,2. It distinguishes itself from other primary liver cancers by its peculiar target group, i.e. adolescents and young adults, as well as its occurrence in absence of pre-existing chronic liver disease1,2. In addition to these specific clinical features, FLC is also characterized by its peculiar histology, i.e. lamellar bands3,4. Over the years, genomic analysis efforts have shed light on the genetic alterations linked to this clinically and histologically distinct liver cancer type. In 2014, the presence of a chromosomal rearrangement on chromosome 19 was described, which generates an in-frame chimeric fusion between the DNAJB1 and PRKACA genes, and concomitantly poses an intergenic deletion of ca. 400 kb5,6.

Methods: By using 78 clinically annotated FLC samples, we performed whole-transcriptome (n = 58), single-nucleotide polymorphism array (n = 41), and next-generation sequencing (n = 48) analyses; we also assessed the prevalence of the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript associated with this cancer (n = 73). We performed class discovery using non-negative matrix factorization, and functional annotation using gene-set enrichment analyses, nearest template prediction, ingenuity pathway analyses, and immunohistochemistry. The genomic identification of significant targets in a cancer algorithm was used to identify chromosomal aberrations, MuTect and VarScan2 were used to identify somatic mutations, and the random survival forest was used to determine patient prognoses. Findings were validated in an independent cohort. Results: Unsupervised gene expression clustering showed 3 robust molecular classes of tumors: the proliferation class (51% of samples) had altered expression of genes that regulate proliferation and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling activation; the inflammation class (26% of samples) had altered expression of genes that regulate inflammation and cytokine enriched production; and the unannotated class (23% of samples) had a gene expression signature that was not associated previously with liver tumors. Expression of genes that regulate neuroendocrine function, as well as histologic markers of cholangiocytes and hepatocytes, were detected in all 3 classes. FLCs had few copy number variations; the most frequent were focal amplification at 8q24.3 (in 12.5% of samples), and deletions at 19p13 (in 28% of samples) and 22q13.32 (in 25% of samples). The DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript was detected in 79% of samples. FLC samples also contained mutations in cancer-related genes such as BRCA2 (in 4.2% of samples), which are uncommon in liver neoplasms. However, FLCs did not contain mutations most commonly detected in liver cancers. We identified an 8-gene signature that predicted survival of patients wi\n",

            "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression is closely related to pathological fibrosis, which involves heterotypic intercellular interactions (HIIs) between liver cancer cells and fibroblasts. Here, we studied them in a direct coculture model, and identified fibronectin from fibroblasts and integrin-\u03b15\u03b21 from liver cancer cells as the primary responsible molecules utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology. Coculture led to the formation of 3D multilayer microstructures, and obvious fibronectin remodeling was caused by upregulated integrin-\u03b15\u03b21, which greatly promoted cell growth in 3D microstructures. Integrin-\u03b15 was more sensitive and specific than integrin-\u03b21 in this process. Subsequent mechanistic exploration revealed the activation of integrin-Src-FAK, AKT and ERK signaling pathways. Importantly, the growth-promoting effect of HIIs was verified in a xenograft tumor model, in which more blood vessels were observed in bigger tumors derived from the coculture group than that derived from monocultured groups. Hence, we conducted triculture by introducing human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which aligned to and differentiated along multilayer microstructures in an integrin-\u03b15\u03b21 dependent manner. Furthermore, fibronectin, integrin-\u03b15, and integrin-\u03b21 were upregulated in 52 HCC tumors, and fibronectin was related to microvascular invasion. Our findings identify fibronectin, integrin-\u03b15, and integrin-\u03b21 as tumor microenvironment-related targets and provide a basis for combination targeted therapeutic strategies for future HCC treatment.

            "Background & aims: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a key role in the cancer process, but the research progress is hampered by the paucity of preclinical models that are essential for mechanistic dissection of cancer cell-CAF interactions. Here, we aimed to establish 3-dimensional (3D) organotypic co-cultures of primary liver tumor-derived organoids with CAFs, and to understand their interactions and the response to treatment. Methods: Liver tumor organoids and CAFs were cultured from murine and human primary liver tumors. 3D co-culture models of tumor organoids with CAFs and Transwell culture systems were established in vitro. A xenograft model was used to investigate the cell-cell interactions in vivo. Gene expression analysis of CAF markers in our hepatocellular carcinoma cohort and an online liver cancer database indicated the clinical relevance of CAFs. Results: To functionally investigate the interactions of liver cancer cells with CAFs, we successfully established murine and human 3D co-culture models of liver tumor organoids with CAFs. CAFs promoted tumor organoid growth in co-culture with direct cell-cell contact and in a Transwell system via paracrine signaling. Vice versa, cancer cells secrete paracrine factors regulating CAF physiology. Co-transplantation of CAFs with liver tumor organoids of mouse or human origin promoted tumor growth in xenograft models. Moreover, tumor organoids conferred resistance to clinically used anticancer drugs including sorafenib, regorafenib, and 5-fluorouracil in the presence of CAFs, or the conditioned medium of CAFs. Conclusions: We successfully established murine and human 3D co-culture models and have shown robust effects of CAFs in liver cancer nurturing and treatment resistance.

            "Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare, lethal, early-onset liver cancer with a critical need for new therapeutics. The primary driver in FLC is the fusion oncoprotein, DNAJ-PKAc, which remains challenging to target therapeutically. It is critical, therefore, to expand understanding of the FLC molecular landscape to identify druggable pathways/targets. Here, we perform the most comprehensive integrative proteo-metabolomic analysis of FLC. We also conduct nutrient manipulation, respirometry analyses, as well as key loss-of-function assays in FLC tumor tissue slices from patients. We propose a model of cellular energetics in FLC pointing to proline anabolism being mediated by ornithine aminotransferase hyperactivity and ornithine transcarbamylase hypoactivity with serine and glutamine catabolism fueling the process. We highlight FLC's potential dependency on voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), a mitochondrial gatekeeper for anions including pyruvate. The metabolic rewiring in FLC that we propose in our model, with an emphasis on mitochondria, can be exploited for therapeutic vulnerabilities.

            "Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC), a rare, lethal hepatic cancer, occurs primarily in adolescents and young adults. Unlike hepatocellular carcinoma, FLC has no known association with viral, metabolic or chemical agents that cause cirrhosis. Currently, surgical resection is the only treatment demonstrated to achieve cure, and no standard of care exists for systemic therapy. Progress in FLC research illuminates a transition from an obscure cancer to one for which an interactive community seems poised to uncover fundamental mechanisms and initiate translation towards novel therapies. In this Roadmap, we review advances since the seminal discovery in 2014 that nearly all FLC tumours express a signature oncogene (DNAJB1\u2013PRKACA) encoding a fusion protein (DNAJ\u2013PKAc) in which the J-domain of a heat shock protein 40 (HSP40) co-chaperone replaces an amino-terminal segment of the catalytic subunit of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Important gains include increased understanding of oncogenic pathways driven by DNAJ\u2013PKAc; identification of potential therapeutic targets; development of research models; elucidation of immune mechanisms with potential for the development of immunotherapies; and completion of the first multicentre clinical trials of targeted therapy for FLC. In each of these key areas we propose a Roadmap for future progress. Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare but devastating disease that disproportionately affects adolescents and young adults and is characterized by the fusion oncogene DNAJB1\u2013PRKACA. There is a critical need to establish new cellular and animal models of FLC to perform reliable functional and preclinical studies. Efforts to directly inhibit cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) catalytic activity for FLC therapy might be constrained by the important role of the normal enzyme in multiple tissues; a deeper understanding of mechanisms underlying cellular transformation by the oncogenic chimaera remains essential to defining tractable pharmacological targets. Advances in the genetic and molecular underpinnings of FLC, in part through the application of genome-scale techniques, reveal promising avenues for new targeted therapeutic strategies and motivate higher-resolution single-cell and spatial approaches. Immunotherapy for FLC must overcome the challenge of generating responses against a low-tumour mutational burden cance\n",

There is no clear standard of care for the disease, whose response to treatment seems to be very different from that of hepatocellular carcinoma. We present a case of FLC in a patient in her mid 30s that recurred and persisted despite resection and multiple lines of treatment. Following transcriptomic analysis, a combination of ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1) led to complete remission, although common biomarkers for immune checkpoint blockade were all negative in this case. The patient is still in remission. Here, combined checkpoint blockade guided by novel transcriptomic analysis led to complete remission after failure of several lines of treatment. Keywords: Biomarkers, Tumor; Genetic Markers; Immunotherapy; Liver Neoplasms Innovative transcriptomic analysis based on synthetic rescue markers unexpectedly predicted response to anti-CTLA4 combined with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in a patient with DNAJB1-PRKACA-bearing fibrolamellar cancer, and administration of this therapy yielded a complete remission, despite the tumor having progressed on anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, and being PD-L1 negative, tumor mutational burden low, and microsatellite stable. Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare liver cancer that primarily occurs in adolescents and young adults who have no history of liver disease. In the early stages of the disease, affected patients often have no symptoms; therefore, by the time the cancer is found, it may have already spread beyond the liver.1 2 FLC is different from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in that it affects young people with norm\n",

            "Pediatric tumors are relatively infrequent, but are often associated with significant lethality and lifelong morbidity. A major goal of pediatric cancer research has been to identify key drivers of tumorigenesis to eventually develop targeted therapies to enhance cure rate and minimize acute and long-term toxic effects. Here, we used genomic approaches to identify biomarkers and candidate drivers for fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC), a very rare subtype of pediatric liver cancer for which limited therapeutic options exist. In-depth genomic analyses of one tumor followed by immunohistochemistry validation on seven other tumors showed expression of neuroendocrine markers in FL-HCC. DNA and RNA sequencing data further showed that common cancer pathways are not visibly altered in FL-HCC but identified two novel structural variants, both resulting in fusion transcripts. The first, a 400 kb deletion, results in a DNAJB1-PRKCA fusion transcript, which leads to increased cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity in the index tumor case and other FL-HCC cases compared with normal liver. This PKA fusion protein is oncogenic in HCC cells. The second gene fusion event, a translocation between the CLPTM1L and GLIS3 genes, generates a transcript whose product also promotes cancer phenotypes in HCC cell lines. These experiments further highlight the tumorigenic role of gene fusions in the etiology of pediatric solid tumors and identify both candidate biomarkers and possible therapeutic targets for this lethal pediatric disease. \u00a9 The Author 2014.

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Cancer progression involves multiple genetic and epigenetic events, which involve gain-of-functions of oncogenes and loss-of-functions of tumor suppressor genes. Classical tumor suppressor genes are recessive in nature, anti-proliferative, and frequently found inactivated or mutated in cancers. However, extensive research over the last few years have elucidated that certain tumor suppressor genes do not conform to these standard definitions and might act as \u201cdouble agents\u201d, playing contrasting roles in vivo in cells, where either due to haploinsufficiency, epigenetic hypermethylation, or due to involvement with multiple genetic and oncogenic events, they play an enhanced proliferative role and facilitate the pathogenesis of cancer. This review discusses and highlights some of these exceptions; the genetic events, cellular contexts, and mechanisms by which four important tumor suppressors\u2014pRb, PTEN, FOXO, and PML display their oncogenic potentials and pro-survival traits in cancer. Keywords: tumor suppressor genes, Rb, PTEN, FOXO, PML, cancer The concept of suppression of oncogenesis has well preceded the actual discovery of tumor suppressor genes. The seminal work by Henri Harris first highlighted the concept of tumor suppressor gene (TSG) [1]. He established that malignancy, a dominant character of tumor cells, can be suppressed in hybrid cells formed by the fusion of malignant and non-malignant \u201cnormal\u201d cells, and that a loss of chromosome during segregation in these hybrids may result in reversion to malignancy. This indicates that the normal cells contributed a balancing factor to the hybrid cells to suppress their highly malignant character. The concept of tumor suppression was further solidified by Alfred Knudson\u2019s epidemiological study of retinoblastoma patients [2] that originated the \u201ctwo-hit hypothesis\u201d. He discussed that both the alleles of a gene need to be lost or mutated for the tumor to develop into a cancer. Further, TSGs in their potential capacity as gatekeepers and caretakers are responsible for suppressing \u201cdamaged\u201d ce\n",

            "Cancer development and its response to therapy are regulated by inflammation, which either promotes or suppresses tumor progression, potentially displaying opposing effects on therapeutic outcomes. Chronic inflammation facilitates tumor progression and treatment resistance, whereas induction of acute inflammatory reactions often stimulates the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and antigen presentation, leading to anti-tumor immune responses. In addition, multiple signaling pathways, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT), toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways, cGAS/STING, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); inflammatory factors, including cytokines (e.g., interleukin (IL), interferon (IFN), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1), chemokines (e.g., C-C motif chemokine ligands (CCLs) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligands (CXCLs)), growth factors (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2), and inflammasome; as well as inflammatory metabolites including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxane, and specialized proresolving mediators (SPM), have been identified as pivotal regulators of the initiation and resolution of inflammation. Nowadays, local irradiation, recombinant cytokines, neutralizing antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors, DC vaccines, oncolytic viruses, TLR agonists, and SPM have been developed to specifically modulate inflammation in cancer therapy, with some of these factors already undergoing clinical trials. Herein, we discuss the initiation and resolution of inflammation, the crosstalk between tumor development and inflammatory processes. We also highlight potential targets for harnessing inflammation in the treatment of cancer. Despite the employment in the clinical setting of a series of strategies for cancer treatment (e.g., surgery, chemotherapy, irradiation, and immunotherapy), cancer-related mortality remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for 13% of all human deaths.1 Because cancer is considered a cell-intrinsic genetic disease, most treatment modalities are focused on killing tumor cells directly, with multidrug resistance of cancer cells being a crucial reason for the low efficacy of cancer therapy.2,3 Inflammation has been demonstrated closely associated with all stages of development and mali\n",

Despite advancements in cancer treatments in general in the last few decades, incidence and mortality have not changed. Even though some phase 1 and 2 studies have shown promising results, many medication have failed to reach a sustainable level of efficacy to move into the clinical setting. Immunotherapy drugs have shown impressive results in the treatment of specific immunogenic cancers, prompting the possibility of their use in liver cancers. Immunotherapy medications approved for other cancers have received FDA accelerated approval for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. But, these approvals are contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. With more treatments in development involving cancer vaccines and natural killer cell\u2013mediated therapy, liver cancer treatment is being reinvigorated with a broad array of new treatment angles. In this review article, we discuss these treatments, focusing on mechanism of action and clinical trials. Much needed advancements in treating late- and early-stage liver cancers will require new and innovative immunotherapeutic treatments. Keywords: liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, immunotherapy, durvalumab, ipilimumab, nivolumab Liver cancer is a subset of cancers that include malignancies of hepatocytes, surrounding blood vessels, and the hepatic bile ducts. Factors such as stage at diagnosis, patients\u2019 general health condition, and response to treatments affect overall survival from liver cancer. Despite advances in the field of oncology, overall prognosis of liver cancer remains poor as compared to other malignancies. Over a six-year period from 2009 to 2015, liver cancer showed the second lowest five-year survival rate of 18%.1 The American Cancer Society estimates that 42,810 new cases and 30,160 deaths will be caused by liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancers in 2020.1 This places liver cancer in the top five for cancer deaths while it is outside of the top ten in new cases diagnosed.

            "The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) are foundational resources in cancer research, providing extensive molecular and phenotypic data. However, large-scale proteomic data across various cancer types for these cohorts remain limited. Here, we expand upon our previous work to generate high-quality protein expression data for approximately 8,000 TCGA patient samples and around 900 CCLE cell line samples, covering 447 clinically relevant proteins, using reverse-phase protein arrays. These protein expression profiles offer profound insights into intertumor heterogeneity and cancer dependency and serve as sensitive functional readouts for somatic alterations. We develop a systematic protein-centered strategy for identifying synthetic lethality pairs and experimentally validate an interaction between protein kinase A subunit \u03b1 and epidermal growth factor receptor. We also identify metastasis-related protein markers with clinical relevance. This dataset represents a valuable resource for advancing our understanding of cancer mechanisms, discovering protein biomarkers and developing innovative therapeutic strategies.

Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL\u2010HCC) has historically been classified as a rare subtype of HCC. However, unlike \u201cclassic\u201d HCC, it occurs in children and young adults without underlying liver disease. The recent discovery of a deletion mutation in all FL\u2010HCCs represented a major advancement in understanding the pathogenesis of this disease. This deletion results in the fusion of the genes encoding a heat shock protein (DNAJB1) and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA, PRKACA), and overexpression of PRKACA and enhanced cAMP\u2010dependent PKA activity. This review summarizes recent advancements in FL\u2010HCC pathogenesis and characteristics of the HSP40\u2010PKA C protein. Keywords: carcinoma, fibrolamellar, hepatocellular, protein kinase A fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma protein kinase A Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL\u2010HCC) is a primary liver cancer that occurs in young people without underlying liver disease. It was first described as a unique subtype of HCC by Edmondson in 1956 and was named FL\u2010HCC by Craig in 1980.1, 2 It accounts for less than 1% of all primary liver cancers, but represents the majority of HCCs in patients younger than 30 years of age.3, 4, 5, 6 Due to the rarity of FL\u2010HCC and a lack of representative experimental systems, the molecular basis for carcinogenesis in these tumors has been elusive and difficult to study. Recently, however, there have been significant breakthroughs in our understanding of the pathogenesis of FL\u2010HCC. Honeyman and colleagues discovered a novel, chimeric transcript that is present in all studied samples of FL\u2010HCC.7 Our group and others have confirmed that this mutation is unique to FL\u2010HCC, and expanded our knowledge of how this mutation functions in the liver.[8,9, manuscript in press] In this review, we present data supporting the notion that the DNAJB1\u2010PRKACA mutati\n",

            "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. While many targeted therapies have been developed, the majority of HCC tumors do not harbor clinically actionable mutations. Protein-level aberrations, especially those not evident at the genomic level, present therapeutic opportunities but have rarely been systematically characterized in HCC. In this study, we performed proteogenomic analyses of 260 primary tumors from two HBV-related HCC patient cohorts with global mass-spectrometry (MS) proteomics data. Combining tumor-normal and inter-tumor analyses, we identified overexpressed targets including PDGFRB, FGFR4, ERBB2/3, CDK6 kinases and MFAP5, HMCN1, and Hsp proteins in HCC, many of which showed low frequencies of genomic and/or transcriptomic aberrations. Protein expression of FGFR4 kinase and Hsp proteins were significantly associated with response to their corresponding inhibitors. Our results provide a catalog of protein targets in HCC and demonstrate the potential of proteomics approaches in advancing precision medicine in cancer types lacking druggable mutations.

            "Senior co-corresponding author Paul Thomas, PhD, St. Jude Department of Host-Microbe Interactions Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare liver cancer with a poor prognosis if not addressed early with surgery. The disease is caused by a single genetic mutation that creates a fusion protein. Scientists at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital and The University of Tennessee Health Science Center discovered an immune cell protein that can target and spark the destruction of FLC. Scientists found naturally occurring T cells in a patient with FLC were uniquely capable of recognizing the fusion protein. These cells provide a basis for developing a novel immunotherapy treatment approach for FLC. The findings were published today in Cell Reports Medicine. Fusion proteins result from DNA damage that joins together two different genes. Sometimes, the hybrid gene produces a fusion protein that helps cells become cancerous. All FLC tumors are driven by the fusion of the genes DNAJB1 and PRKACA, occurring at the same place in the genome in more than 90% of FLC patients. Since this fusion protein does not exist in normal cells, the immune system should be able to find it and destroy the cancer cells harboring the fusion. However, this concept relies on T cells recognizing the fusion protein and responding to it. The St. Jude\u2013UTHSC team found two rare T cells that can do just that. This discovery shows a proof-of-concept for a novel treatment approach. \u201cWe used a patient\u2019s T-cell receptor that led T cells to kill the tumor cells with the fusion protein,\u201d Allison Kirk, St. Jude Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. \u201cThis approach worked very well in a mouse model.\u201d T cells are a type of white blood cell that finds and kills infected or cancerous cells in the body. These immune cells find their targets using the T-cell receptor, which guides the cells to one specific protein on a tumor, akin to law enforcement using facial recognition to find a criminal. The FLC-causing fusion protein represents a dangerous fugitive in the body that is difficult to identify. In 60-80% of cases, an FLC tumor cannot be surgically removed, and even after treatment, the disease relapses, with patients succumbing within 10 years. Outside of surgery, no effective therapies exist, motivating scientists to find a new approach. When the scientists put a T-cell receptor that recognized the fusion p\n",

            "Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare, therapeutically intractable liver cancer that disproportionately affects youth. Although FLC tumors exhibit a distinct gene expression profile, the chromatin regulatory landscape and the genes most critical for tumor cell survival remain unclear. Here, we use chromatin run-on sequencing to discover \u223c7,000 enhancers and 141 enhancer hotspots activated in FLC relative to nonmalignant liver. Bioinformatic analyses reveal aberrant ERK/MEK signaling and candidate master transcriptional regulators. We also define the genes most strongly associated with hotspots of FLC enhancer activity, including CA12 and SLC16A14. Treatment of FLC cell models with inhibitors of CA12 or SLC16A14 independently reduce cell viability and/or significantly enhance the effect of the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib.

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death. The major forms of primary liver cancer are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). Both these tumors develop against a background of cirrhotic liver, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic liver damage and fibrosis. HCC is a heterogeneous disease which usually develops within liver cirrhosis related to various etiologies: hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (frequent in Asia and Africa), hepatitis C virus (HCV), chronic alcohol abuse, or metabolic syndrome (frequent in Western countries). In cirrhosis, hepatocarcinogenesis is a multi-step process where pre-cancerous dysplastic macronodules transform progressively into HCC. The patterns of genomic alterations observed in these tumors were recently identified and were instrumental for the identification of potential targeted therapies that could improve patient care. Liver cancer stem cells are a small subset of undifferentiated liver tumor cells, responsible for cancer initiation, metastasis, relapse and chemoresistance, enriched and isolated according to immunophenotypic and functional properties: cell surface proteins (CD133, CD90, CD44, EpCAM, OV-6, CD13, CD24, DLK1, \u03b12\u03b41, ICAM-1 and CD47); the functional markers corresponding to side population, high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and autofluorescence.

Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a lethal primary liver cancer, affecting young patients in absence of chronic liver disease. Molecular understanding of FLC tumorigenesis is limited, partly due to the scarcity of experimental models. Here, we CRISPR-engineer human hepatocyte organoids to recreate different FLC backgrounds, including the predominant genetic alteration, the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion, as well as a recently reported background of FLC-like tumors, encompassing inactivating mutations of BAP1 and PRKAR2A. Phenotypic characterizations and comparisons with primary FLC tumor samples revealed mutant organoid-tumor similarities. All FLC mutations caused hepatocyte dedifferentiation, yet only combined loss of BAP1 and PRKAR2A resulted in hepatocyte transdifferentiation into liver ductal/progenitor-like cells that could exclusively grow in a ductal cell environment. BAP1-mutant hepatocytes represent primed cells attempting to proliferate in this cAMP-stimulating environment, but require concomitant PRKAR2A loss to overcome cell cycle arrest. In all analyses, DNAJB1-PRKACAfus organoids presented with milder phenotypes, suggesting differences between FLC genetic backgrounds, or for example the need for additional mutations, interactions with niche cells, or a different cell-of-origin. These engineered human organoid models facilitate the study of FLC. Subject terms: Mechanisms of disease, Paediatric cancer, Genetic engineering An in-depth unde\n",

            "Background & aims: A causal link has recently been established between epigenetic alterations and hepatocarcinogenesis, indicating that epigenetic inhibition may have therapeutic potential. We aimed to identify and target epigenetic modifiers that show molecular alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: We studied the molecular-clinical correlations of epigenetic modifiers including bromodomains, histone acetyltransferases, lysine methyltransferases and lysine demethylases in HCC using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data of 365 patients with HCC. The therapeutic potential of epigenetic inhibitors was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing analysis and its correlation with expression and clinical data in the TCGA dataset were used to identify expression programs normalized by Jumonji lysine demethylase (JmjC) inhibitors. Results: Genetic alterations, aberrant expression, and correlation between tumor expression and poor patient prognosis of epigenetic enzymes are common events in HCC. Epigenetic inhibitors that target bromodomain (JQ-1), lysine methyltransferases (BIX-1294 and LLY-507) and JmjC lysine demethylases (JIB-04, GSK-J4 and SD-70) reduce HCC aggressiveness. The pan-JmjC inhibitor JIB-04 had a potent antitumor effect in tumor bearing mice. HCC cells treated with JmjC inhibitors showed overlapping changes in expression programs related with inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell death. JmjC inhibition reverses an aggressive HCC gene expression program that is also altered in patients with HCC. Several genes downregulated by JmjC inhibitors are highly expressed in tumor vs. non-tumor parenchyma, and their high expression correlates with a poor prognosis. We identified and validated a 4-gene expression prognostic signature consisting of CENPA, KIF20A, PLK1, and NCAPG. Conclusions: The epigenetic alterations identified in HCC can be used to predict prognosis and to define a subgroup of high-risk patients that would potentially benefit from JmjC inhibitor therapy. Lay summary: In this study, we found that mutations and changes in expression of epigenetic modifiers are common events in human hepatocellular carcinoma, leading to an aggressive gene expression program and poor clinical prognosis. The transcriptional program can be reversed by pharmacological inhibition of Jumonji enzymes. This inhibition blocks hepatocell\n",

            "Proteogenomic analyses of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) have focused on early-stage, HBV-associated HCCs. Here we present an integrated proteogenomic analysis of HCCs across clinical stages and etiologies. Pathways related to cell cycle, transcriptional and translational control, signaling transduction, and metabolism are dysregulated and differentially regulated on the genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and phosphoproteomic levels. We describe candidate copy number-driven driver genes involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, the Wnt-\u03b2-catenin, AKT/mTOR and Notch pathways, cell cycle and DNA damage regulation. The targetable aurora kinase A and CDKs are upregulated. CTNNB1 and TP53 mutations are associated with altered protein phosphorylation related to actin filament organization and lipid metabolism, respectively. Integrative proteogenomic clusters show that HCC constitutes heterogeneous subgroups with distinct regulation of biological processes, metabolic reprogramming and kinase activation. Our study provides a comprehensive overview of the proteomic and phophoproteomic landscapes of HCCs, revealing the major pathways altered in the (phospho)proteome. Liver cancer, of which 75\u201385% are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), caused 782,000 deaths globally in 20181. Genomic analyses have revealed that TERT promoter, CTNNB1 (encoding \u03b2-catenin) and TP53 (encoding p53) are frequently mutated in HCC, while genes involved in other critical processes, such as oxidative stress response, chromatin remodeling and hepatocyte differentiation, are recurrently mutated but in <10% of HCC2,3,4. Transcriptomic subtyping has revealed HCC subclasses that differ in the expression of genes related to proliferation, stemness, metabolism, hepatocyte differentiation and liver function5,6,7,8,9,10. More recently, three mass spectrometry-based proteogenomic studies of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCCs have been published11,12,13. In the first study, the proteome profiling of early-stage HBV-associated HCCs found that a subset of HCCs characterized by disrupted cholesterol homeostasis and SOAT1 overexpression was associated with poor outcome11. Indeed, avasimibe, a SOAT1 inhibitor, effectively reduced the size of tumors overexpressing SOAT1 in patient-derived xenograft models11.

In its early years, mass spectrometry (MS)\u2010based proteomics focused on the cataloging of proteins found in different species or different tissues. By 2005, proteomics was being used for protein quantitation, typically based on \u201cproteotypic\u201d peptides which act as surrogates for the parent proteins. Biomarker discovery is usually done by non\u2010targeted \u201cshotgun\u201d proteomics, using relative quantitation methods to determine protein expression changes that correlate with disease (output given as \u201cup\u2010or\u2010down regulation\u201d or \u201cfold\u2010increases\u201d). MS\u2010based techniques can also perform \u201cabsolute\u201d quantitation which is required for clinical applications (output given as protein concentrations).

            "Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) is a rare variant of HCC that most frequently affects young adults. Because of its rarity and an absence of preclinical models, our understanding of FL-HCC is limited. Our objective was to analyze chromosomal alterations and dysregulated gene expression in tumor specimens collected at a single center during two decades of experience with FL-HCC. We analyzed 38 specimens from 26 patients by array comparative genomic hybridiziation (aCGH) and 35 specimens from 15 patients by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). All tumor specimens exhibited genomic instability, with a higher frequency of genomic amplifications or deletions in metastatic tumors. The regions encoding 71 microRNAs (miRs) were deleted in at least 25% of tumor specimens. Five of these recurrently deleted miRs targeted the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) gene product, and a correlating 100-fold upregulation of IGF2BP1 mRNA was seen in tumor specimens. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated intrapatient tumor similarity, independent of recurrence site or time. The p53 tumor suppressor pathway was downregulated as demonstrated by both aCGH and RNA-seq analysis. Notch, EGFR, NRAS, and RB1 pathways were also significantly dysregulated in tumors compared with normal liver tissue. The findings illuminate the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of this rare disease and provide insight into dysregulated oncogenic pathways and potential therapeutic targets in FL-HCC.

Eukaryotic cells undergo continuous telomere shortening as a consequence of multiple rounds of replications. During tumorigenesis, cells have to acquire telomere DNA maintenance mechanisms (TMMs) in order to counteract telomere shortening, to preserve telomeres from DNA damage repair systems and to avoid telomere-mediated senescence and/or apoptosis. For this reason, telomere maintenance is an essential step in cancer progression. Most human tumors maintain their telomeres expressing telomerase, whereas a lower but significant proportion activates the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. However, evidence about the coexistence of ALT and telomerase has been found both in vivo in the same cancer populations and in vitro in engineered cellular models, making the distinction between telomerase- and ALT-positive tumors elusive. Indeed, after the development of drugs able to target telomerase, the capability for some cancer cells to escape death, switching from telomerase to ALT, was highlighted. Unfortunately, to date, the mechanism underlying the possible switching or the coexistence of telomerase and ALT within the same cell or populations is not completely understood and different factors could be involved. In recent years, different studies have tried to shed light on the complex regulation network that controls the transition between the two TMMs, suggesting a role for embryonic cancer origin, epigenetic modifications, and specific genes activation\u2014both in vivo and in vitro. In this review, we examine recent findings about the cancer-associated differential activation of the two known TMMs and the possible factors implicated in this process. Furthermore, some studies on cancers are also described that did not display any TMM.

            "Background: Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare primary liver cancer of young adults. A functional chimeric transcript resulting from the in-frame fusion of the DNAJ homolog, subfamily B, member 1 (DNAJB1), and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PRKACA) genes on chromosome 19 is believed to be unique in FLC, with a possible role in pathogenesis, yet with no established therapeutic value. The objective of the current study was to understand the molecular landscape of FLC and to identify potential novel therapeutic targets. Methods: Archival fresh, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples from patients with FLC who prospectively consented to an institutional review board-approved protocol were analyzed using Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT), a next-generation sequencing assay encompassing up to 468 key cancer genes. Custom targeted RNA-Seq was performed in selected patients. Demographics, treatment, and outcome data were collected prospectively. Survival outcomes were estimated and correlated with mutation and/or copy number alterations. Results: A total of 33 tumor samples from 31 patients with FLC were analyzed. The median age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 18 years and approximately 53% were women. The DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript was detected in 100% of patients. In 10 of 31 patients in which MSK-IMPACT did not detect the fusion, its presence was confirmed by targeted RNA-Seq. TERT promoter mutation was the second most common, and was detected in 7 patients. The median follow up was 30 months (range, 6-153 months). The 3-year overall survival rate was 84% (95% CI, 61%-93%). Conclusions: The DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript is nonspecific and nonsensitive to FLC. Its potential therapeutic value currently is under evaluation. Opportunities currently are under development for therapy that may be driven or related to the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript or any therapeutic target identified from next-generation sequencing in patients with FLC.

            "Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) of the liver is a rare type of liver cancer that is prevalent in children and young adults, often less than 40 years old. The etiology is unclear. It presents without underlying liver disease with distinctive histological features such as fibrous collagen bands surrounding the tumor cells. Fusion protein DNAJB1-PRKACA is found in most of the cases. The prognosis of FLC is poor. Even though curative treatment option is surgery for a certain patient population, other treatment modalities including radiation, chemotherapy are currently being used without significant improvement of overall survival. Recently, targeted therapy and immunotherapy have been studied which may provide survival advantage in the future.

Fibrolamellar carcinomas are a unique type of primary liver cancer. They occur most commonly in children and young adults. Their etiology remains a mystery, as they are not associated with chronic liver disease. Fibrolamellar carcinomas are not indolent tumors, but have an overall better prognosis than typical hepatocellular carcinomas, in part because of the younger age at presentation and the lack of cirrhosis. The most important prognostic feature is whether the tumor is resectable. Histologically, the tumor is made up of large cells that contain abundant mitochondria. The nuclei of the tumor cells have prominent nucleoli. The tumor cells induce the formation of extensive intratumoral fibrosis, which often grows in parallel, or lamellar bands. The tumor cells clearly show hepatocellular features but are also unique in showing both biliary and neuroendocrine differentiation. The uniqueness of fibrolamellar carcinoma extends to their molecular findings. While the genetic abnormalities that lead to fibrolamellar carcinomas are not yet known, studies have shown that they lack mutations in the genes most commonly mutated in typical hepatocellular carcinoma (TP53 and CTNNB1). In this paper, the clinical, pathological, and basic science literature on fibrolamellar carcinoma is comprehensively reviewed. Key areas of needed research are also discussed. Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) was first described as a unique entity in 1956 by Edmondson [1], who described it as a unique form of primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Craig et al. further developed the striking clinical predilection for younger individuals and the characteristic histological features in 1980 [2]. This 1980 study was also the first to use the term \u201cfibrolamellar carcinoma.\u201d Subsequent case reports and cases series have confirmed and expanded the unique clinical and pathologic features of FLC. Major review articles on the clinical, pathological, and biological findings have been published in 2007 [3], 2009 [4], and 2011 [5]. While earlier editions of t\n",

            "Although the zebrafish has many attributes of a promising cancer model, one outstanding question is how similar zebrafish and human tumors are at the molecular level. To date, supporting data from histology and 'gene-to-gene' comparisons with human data offer limited insights. Using comparative microarray analyses, we found striking molecular similarities between zebrafish and human liver neoplasia. Our data indicate that zebrafish liver tumors possess the general molecular hallmarks of human liver cancer and some of the molecular similarities extend to the progression of liver tumors. The molecular conservation between fish and human liver tumors underscored the strong association and fundamental importance of these genes in liver neoplasia as well as their clinical potentials as diagnostic markers and/or therapeutic targets. In addition, our comparative oncogenomic work provides a general framework for comparing and validating microarray data of zebrafish model with human cancer, thus adding confidence of using the zebrafish to model human cancers.

Pediatric tumors are relatively infrequent, but are often associated with significant lethality and lifelong morbidity. A major goal of pediatric cancer research has been to identify key drivers of tumorigenesis to eventually develop targeted therapies to enhance cure rate and minimize acute and long-term toxic effects. Here, we used genomic approaches to identify biomarkers and candidate drivers for fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC), a very rare subtype of pediatric liver cancer for which limited therapeutic options exist. In-depth genomic analyses of one tumor followed by immunohistochemistry validation on seven other tumors showed expression of neuroendocrine markers in FL-HCC. DNA and RNA sequencing data further showed that common cancer pathways are not visibly altered in FL-HCC but identified two novel structural variants, both resulting in fusion transcripts. The first, a 400 kb deletion, results in a DNAJB1-PRKCA fusion transcript, which leads to increased cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity in the index tumor case and other FL-HCC cases compared with normal liver. This PKA fusion protein is oncogenic in HCC cells. The second gene fusion event, a translocation between the CLPTM1L and GLIS3 genes, generates a transcript whose product also promotes cancer phenotypes in HCC cell lines. These experiments further highlight the tumorigenic role of gene fusions in the etiology of pediatric solid tumors and identify both candidate biomarkers and possible therapeutic targets for this lethal pediatric disease. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the primary cause of liver cancer and the third leading cause of cancer mortality, with more than 600 000 deaths annually. In the majority of cases, chronic hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections are responsible for the development of the disease, but other factors such as alcohol consumption and exposure to aflatoxin B1 contribute to cancer development (1,2). HCC is usually a cancer found in older adults, and primary hepatic carcinomas are rare in people younger than 20 years. In this age group, approximately \n",

            "This paper aims to present a detailed overview of fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC), a variant of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that accounts for approximately 1-9% of all cases a. according to the SEER database. Despite ongoing research, the aetiology of FLC tumours remains unclear. Nevertheless, FLC is believed to have a better overall prognosis than other primary liver tumours, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. This study aims to present a comprehensive overview of fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC), with a focus on its epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. FLC frequently incorporate features of stomach pain, weight loss, and malaise in their clinical signs and symptoms, which are generally nonspecific Ultimately, the most common physical finding is an abdominal mass or hepatomegaly. With this said, several unusual presentations have been documented such as Budd Chiari syndrome, severe anaemia, non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis and many more. In regards to this tumour's genetic analysis, it is characterised by a 400 kb deletion on chromosome 19 leading to a functional DNAJB1-PRKACA chimeric transcript in addition to tetraploidy in 50% of cases. FLC is chromosomally stable as compared to typical HCC. mTOR pathway activation has also been found to play a critical role in 47% of these tumours and EFGR over-expression is also evident. Fibrolamellar carcinomas (FLCs) exhibit a distinctive gross appearance, characterized by a yellow to pale tan colour, with a consistency that can vary from soft to firm and hard. In addition, a central scar is observed in 60-70% of FLC cases. The central scar is typically white or grey in colour and has a fibrous appearance, which is often surrounded by nodular, tumour-like tissue. Its histologic appearance is characterized by large polygonal cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, large vesiculated nuclei, large nucleoli, and arranged in lamellar bands of collagen fibres. Lamellar bands of fibrosis, consisting of collagen type I, III and IV, have also been identified as a distinctive histologic feature that is observed under low power magnification. Ultrasound, CT and MRI along with image guided biopsy are the primary modalities in diagnosis. Current management options include systemic therapy which has thus far been unremarkable with platinum-based therapies \n",

            "Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a liver tumor with a high mortality burden and few treatment options. A promising therapeutic vulnerability in FLC is its driver mutation, a conserved DNAJB1-PRKACA gene fusion that could be an ideal target neoantigen for immunotherapy. In this study, we aim to define endogenous CD8 T cell responses to this fusion in FLC patients and evaluate fusion-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) for use in cellular immunotherapies. We observe that fusion-specific CD8 T cells are rare and that FLC patient TCR repertoires lack large clusters of related TCR sequences characteristic of potent antigen-specific responses, potentially explaining why endogenous immune responses are insufficient to clear FLC tumors. Nevertheless, we define two functional fusion-specific TCRs, one of which has strong anti-tumor activity in vivo. Together, our results provide insights into the fragmented nature of neoantigen-specific repertoires in humans and indicate routes for clinical development of successful immunotherapies for FLC.

Unlike tumor cells, stromal cell types within the tumor microenvironment (TME) are genetically stable, and thus represent an attractive therapeutic target with reduced risk of resistance and tumor recurrence. However, specifically disrupting the pro-tumorigenic TME is a challenging undertaking, as the TME has diverse capacities to induce both beneficial and adverse consequences for tumorigenesis. Furthermore, many studies have shown that the microenvironment is capable of normalizing tumor cells, suggesting that reeducation of stromal cells, rather than targeted ablation per se, may be an effective strategy for treating cancer. Here, we will discuss the paradoxical roles of the TME during specific stages of cancer progression and metastasis, and recent therapeutic attempts to re-educate stromal cells within the TME to have anti-tumorigenic effects. Bidirectional communication between cells and their microenvironment is critical for both normal tissue homeostasis, and for tumor growth. In particular, interactions between tumor cells and the associated stroma represent a powerful relationship that influences disease initiation, progression and patient prognosis1. The link between chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis was first proposed by Rudolf Virchow in 1863, following the observation that infiltrating leukocytes were a hallmark of tumors2. Since then, a plethora of studies have contributed to the characterization of the TME and further complicate the already-challenging task of understanding and treating cancer. Whereas cancer had previously been viewed as a heterogeneous disease involving aberrant mutations in tumor cells, it is now evident that tumors are also diverse by nature of their microenvironmental composition, and stromal cell proportions or activation states3,4. In response to evolving environmental conditions and oncogenic signals from growing tumors, the TME continually changes over the course of cancer progression, underscoring the need to consider TME influences on metastasis as a dynamic process, and to understand how tumor cells drive the construction of their own niche. Here we discuss current research that demonstrates a crucial role for different stromal compar\n",

The most effective treatment for FLC is surgical resection, but no standardized systemic therapy exists for patients with recurrent or unresectable FLC. As a first step to understand the immune microenvironment of FLC, we investigated targetable immune-checkpoint pathways, PD-1, PD-L1, B7-H3, IDO-1, and LAG3, in relation to CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte density. Thirty-two FLC tumor specimens were analyzed using IHC staining for PD-L1, CD8, PD-1, IDO, LAG3, and B7-H3. Sixty-three percent of FLC cases demonstrated membranous PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, and almost 70% of cases demonstrated PD-L1+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor-associated macrophages (TIL/TAM). Myeloid-derived cells appeared to be a major component of PD-L1+ tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Forty percent of the cases showed B7-H3 expression in the tumor zone, with 91% cases showing B7-H3 expression in TILs and TAMs. IDO and PD-1 expression was highest in the tumor interface zone. B7-H3 or IDO expression on tumor cells significantly correlated with higher CD8+ T-cell density. In conclusion, a high proportion of FLC cases showed robust expression of PD-1, PD-L1, B7-H3, and IDO in an adaptive immune-resistance pattern.

            "Background: Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a rare form of liver cancer primarily affecting children and young adults. Although considered a subset of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FLC has unique molecular and pathologic characteristics, suggesting that it may require different treatment. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are used in the treatment of HCC, but efficacy and safety in FLC has not been characterized. Methods: We performed a multicenter retrospective analysis of patients with FLC to determine responses to ICI therapy. Response rates were assessed based on RECIST 1.1 criteria, and Kaplan-Meier statistics were used for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: FLC tumors were characterized by low tumor mutational burden (TMB) and absent PD-L1 expression. We identified 19 patients who received ICIs, including 15 who received ICI therapy alone [programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, +/- cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor]. Objective tumor responses were observed in 3/19 patients (15.8%), including 2/15 patients (13.3%) who received ICIs alone, all partial responses. Median PFS and OS were 5.5 and 26.0 months, respectively. Grade 3-4 immune related adverse events were observed in 4/19 (21.1%) patients. Conclusions: ICI therapy has modest clinical activity in FLC, and novel therapeutic combinations are needed.

            "The DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript is the oncogenic driver in fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma, a lethal disease lacking specific therapies. This study reports on the identification, characterization, and immunotherapeutic application of HLA-presented neoantigens specific for the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript in fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. DNAJB1-PRKACA-derived HLA class I and HLA class II ligands induce multifunctional cytotoxic CD8+ and T-helper 1 CD4+ T cells, and their cellular processing and presentation in DNAJB1-PRKACA expressing tumor cells is demonstrated by mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidome analysis. Single-cell RNA sequencing further identifies multiple T cell receptors from DNAJB1-PRKACA-specific T cells. Vaccination of a fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma patient, suffering from recurrent short interval disease relapses, with DNAJB1-PRKACA-derived peptides under continued Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor therapy induces multifunctional CD4+ T cells, with an activated T-helper 1 phenotype and high T cell receptor clonality. Vaccine-induced DNAJB1-PRKACA-specific T cell responses persist over time and, in contrast to various previous treatments, are accompanied by durable relapse free survival of the patient for more than 21 months post vaccination. Our preclinical and clinical findings identify the DNAJB1-PRKACA protein as source for immunogenic neoepitopes and corresponding T cell receptors and provide efficacy in a single-patient study of T cell-based immunotherapy specifically targeting this oncogenic fusion. T cell-based immunotherapies, comprising immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), CAR-T cells, and bispecific T cell engager antibodies achieved a breakthrough in the treatment of malignant disease1,2,3,4,5, adoptive T cell transfer and vaccination strategies hold further promise6,7,8,9,10. However, these therapies, which rely on the rejection of cancer cells through recognition of tumor antigens and T cell-mediated cytotoxicity are still only available and effective in small subsets of cancer patients and single tumor entities. One main problem for the development of antigen-specific immunotherapies is the lack of suitable target structures that show natural, highly frequent, and tumor-exclusive presentation on the cell surface of tumor cells and are recognized by the immune system11. Tumor antigens are r\n",

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a liver tumor with a high mortality burden and few treatment options. A promising therapeutic vulnerability in FLC is its driver mutation, a conserved DNAJB1-PRKACA gene fusion that could be an ideal target neoantigen for immunotherapy. In this study, we aim to define endogenous CD8 T cell responses to this fusion in FLC patients and evaluate fusion-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) for use in cellular immunotherapies. We observe that fusion-specific CD8 T cells are rare and that FLC patient TCR repertoires lack large clusters of related TCR sequences characteristic of potent antigen-specific responses, potentially explaining why endogenous immune responses are insufficient to clear FLC tumors. Nevertheless, we define two functional fusion-specific TCRs, one of which has strong anti-tumor activity in vivo. Together, our results provide insights into the fragmented nature of neoantigen-specific repertoires in humans and indicate routes for clinical development of successful immunotherapies for FLC. Keywords: fibrolamellar carcinoma, DNAJB1-PRKACA, CD8 T cell, gene fusion, neoantigen, immunotherapy, cell therapy, T cell receptor, TCR repertoire Endogenous CD8 T cell responses against the FLC driver fusion are rare FLC TCR repertoires lack characteristics of effective antiviral T cell responses Rare fusion-specific TCRs are specific and functional and kill tumor cells in vitro Fusion-specific TCR-T cell therapy can have potent anti-tumor activity in vivo Kirk et al. identify rare endogenous CD8 T cell responses against conserved driver fusion neoantigens in fibrolamellar carcinoma, highlighting the potential for developing cell therapies for FLC. The rarity of these endogenous responses and fragmented nature of FLC TCR repertoires also provide insights into how TCR repertoires recognize cancer neoantigens.

Fibrolamellar liver cancer (FLC) is a rare malignancy affecting adolescents and young adults. To better characterize the incidence and biochemical consequences of this disease, we combined a comprehensive analysis of the electronic medical record and national payer data and found that FLC incidence is likely five to eight times higher than previous estimates. By employing unsupervised learning on clinical laboratory data from patients with hyperammonemia, we find that FLC-associated hyperammonemia mirrors metabolic dysregulation in urea cycle disorders. Our findings demonstrate that advanced computational analysis of rich clinical datasets can provide key clinical and biochemical insights into rare cancers. Subject terms: Cancer epidemiology, Liver cancer, Epidemiology Fibrolamellar liver cancer (FLC) is a rare primary liver cancer predominantly found in adolescents and young adults (AYA) without underlying liver disease1. Previously considered a morphological variant of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FLC is now understood to be a separate entity with distinct molecular, histological, demographic, and clinical characteristics2,3.

            "Background: In the USA, fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) accounts for 1-2% of all cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. FLC remains poorly understood. Aim: We aim to investigate the incidence, demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment, and prognosis of patients with FLC. Methods: Data on FLC between 2000 and 2016 were extracted from the SEER database and analyzed. Results: A total of 300 patients with FLC were identified where 126 were male. Median age at diagnosis was 27 \u00b1 22 years. The overall age-adjusted incidence of FLC between 2000 and 2016 was 0.02 per 100,000 per year. A bimodal distribution was observed where the highest incidences occurred between 15-19 years and 70-74 years. Most tumors on presentation were moderately differentiated (20.7%), while the most common stage at presentation was stage 1 (21.7%) followed by stages 3 and 4 (20.0% and 20.3%, respectively); 50.3% of these tumors were surgically resected, while 8.0% received radiation and 45.3% received chemotherapy. One- and 5-year cause-specific survival for FLC was 72.0% and 32.9%, respectively, with a median survival of 32.9 months. HCC had a median survival time of 11.7 months. Patients who were not treated with surgical intervention had about 3 times increased risk for death (HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.68-4.72, P = 0.000). Radiation and chemotherapy did not significantly affect outcomes. Conclusion: FLC presents with a bimodal distribution in both early and elderly individuals. Compared to HCC, FLC has a higher recurrence rate but better survival outcome. Surgical intervention is superior to chemotherapy and radiation.

Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare disease, with limited radiographic reported information. We assessed the imaging patterns of primary and metastatic FLC. CT and MR examinations of patients with FLC were retrospectively reviewed. Imaging features were assessed for primary and recurrent liver tumours, including dimension, enhancement characteristics, and presence or absence of central scars. Locations of nodal and extranodal metastases were also recorded. Of 37 patients (18 males and 19 females; average age, 23.5 years) with FLC, 24 had imaging of their primary tumour; 13 had metastases at presentation and 7 developed metastases on follow-up. The remaining 13 patients had follow-up imaging of metastatic disease. Primary FLC had a mean diameter >11 cm, with central scars in ten (46%) patients. Most tumours enhanced heterogeneously (96%) and showed arterial enhancement (81%). On MRI, 62% of FLCs were hypointense on T1 weighted imaging and 54% were hyperintense on T2 weighted imaging. 13 patients (54%) had nodal metastases at presentation, mostly in the upper abdomen (92%) and commonly in the chest (38%). Extrahepatic metastases were most frequently pulmonary or peritoneal. Predominantly small and homogeneous intrahepatic recurrences were detected on follow-up in 15 patients. FLC often presents as a large hepatic tumour with nodal and distant metastases. Thoracic adenopathy and lung metastases were frequently found in our series, suggesting the need for pre-operative and follow-up chest imaging. Thoracic nodal and lung metastases are common in FLC; therefore, dedicated chest imaging should be part of the evaluation of a patient with FLC. Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare and distinct disease from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It accounts for <1% of primary liver malignancies.1 Compared with conventional HCC, FLC is often found in younger patients, may be slightly more prevalent in females and typically occurs in the absence of cirrhosis or risk factors such as viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.1\u20133 The prognosis of FLC is not fully understood.

FLC is a poorly understood malignancy, which seems to be more prevalent in young patients with no underlying liver diseases. The term \u201cfibrolamellar\u201d is derived from thick fibrous collagen bands surrounding the tumor cells. Unlike HCC, cirrhosis and viral hepatitis infection are not predisposing to FLC, and it is not associated with elevations in serum alpha-fetoprotein. FLC patients often present with vague abdominal pain, nausea, malaise, and weight loss. Most cases present are at an advanced stage at the time of initial diagnosis. However, curative treatment options can still be offered to up to 70% of patients. Surgery (resection/liver transplantation) is the mainstay of treatment and the only potentially curative option. FLCs have been less chemo-responsive than the conventional HCC, however, in advanced cases, multimodality treatments can be effective. Recent advances in molecular studies of FLC have found a unique DNAJB1\u2013PRKACA fusion transcript in most of the cases studied. The review aims to describe clinical characteristics, diagnostic methods, and therapeutic modalities for this rare tumor to raise awareness among clinicians and surgeons.

            "To repurpose therapeutics for fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC), we developed and validated patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from surgical resections. Most agents used clinically and inhibitors of oncogenes overexpressed in FLC showed little efficacy on PDX. A high-throughput functional drug screen found primary and metastatic FLC were vulnerable to clinically available inhibitors of TOPO1 and HDAC and to napabucasin. Napabucasin's efficacy was mediated through reactive oxygen species and inhibition of translation initiation, and specific inhibition of eIF4A was effective. The sensitivity of each PDX line inversely correlated with expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL, and inhibition of Bcl-xL synergized with other drugs. Screening directly on cells dissociated from patient resections validated these results. This demonstrates that a direct functional screen on patient tumors provides therapeutically informative data within a clinically useful time frame. Identifying these novel therapeutic targets and combination therapies is an urgent need, as effective therapeutics for FLC are currently unavailable. SIGNIFICANCE: Therapeutics informed by genomics have not yielded effective therapies for FLC. A functional screen identified TOPO1, HDAC inhibitors, and napabucasin as efficacious and synergistic with inhibition of Bcl-xL. Validation on cells dissociated directly from patient tumors demonstrates the ability for functional precision medicine in a solid tumor.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 2355. \u00a92021 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.

The tumor cells are polygonal and deeply eosinophilic, and are embedded in a fibrous stroma. The prognosis is similar to classical hepatocellular carcinoma that arises in non-cirrhotic livers, and better than hepatocellular carcinoma that arises in cirrhotic livers. [1] There are 2 clinical trials for fibrolamellar carcinoma, of which 2 are open and 0 are completed or closed. Of the trials that contain fibrolamellar carcinoma as an inclusion criterion, 1 is phase 1 (1 open) and 1 is phase 1/phase 2 (1 open). DNAJB1-PRKACA is the most frequent gene inclusion criterion for fibrolamellar carcinoma clinical trials [3]. Nivolumab, dnajb1-prkaca peptide vaccine, and fluorouracil are the most common interventions in fibrolamellar carcinoma clinical trials. DNAJB1 + DNAJB1 is an inclusion eligibility criterion in 1 clinical trial for fibrolamellar carcinoma, of which 1 is open and 0 are closed.

Efforts to understand and treat fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) have been confounded by a lack of models that accurately reflect the genetics and biology of the disease. Here we demonstrate that the Dnajb1\u2013Prkaca gene fusion drives tumorigenesis in mice, and that fusion to DNAJB1 drives FL-HCC initiation more effectively than wild-type PRKACA overexpression. The requirement of the PRKACA kinase domain in tumor initiation establishes the potential utility of kinase inhibitors targeting the fusion. By identifying genetic and environmental factors that can enhance the consistency and aggressiveness of disease progression, we reveal biological characteristics of the disease and advance a robust platform for future preclinical studies. Keywords: fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma, CRISPR, mouse cancer models, protein kinase A, \u03b2-catenin A segmental deletion resulting in DNAJB1\u2013PRKACA gene fusion is now recognized as the signature genetic event of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC), a rare but lethal liver cancer that primarily affects adolescents and young adults. Here we implement CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and transposon-mediated somatic gene transfer to demonstrate that expression of either the endogenous fusion protein or a chimeric cDNA leads to the formation of indolent liver tumors in mice that closely resemble human FL-HCC. Notably, overexpression of the wild-type PRKACA was unable to fully recapitulate the oncogenic activity of DNAJB1\u2013PRKACA, implying that FL-HCC does not simply result from enhanced PRKACA expression.

            "Apoptosis, via caspase cascade, is involved in tumorigenesis and progression, and thus, altered apoptosis-related protein expressions have clinical and prognostic significance. Moreover, the apoptosis pathway is highlighted due to the recent introduction of apoptosis-targeted therapy for several genes such as the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). XIAP is the most potent direct inhibitor of caspase, and XIAP-associated factor 1 (XAF1) and secondary mitochondrial activator of caspase/direct IAP-binding protein with low PI (Smac/DIABLO) are negative regulators of XIAP. In this study, we evaluated the expression of these proteins and investigated their clinical and prognostic significance in gastric carcinomas. Immunohistochemical analysis by using the tissue array method was performed for XIAP, survivin, Bcl-2, XAF1, Smac/DIABLO, and cleaved caspase-3 proteins in 1,162 surgically resected gastric carcinoma cases. XIAP expression was related to the advanced stage. The expression of XIAP showed negative relationship with XAF1 and Smac/DIABLO expressions. In addition, XIAP expression was associated with a poor prognosis and was also proved to be an independent prognostic factor. Cleaved caspase-3 expression was related to the early stage. In addition, cleaved caspase-3 expression was associated with a favorable prognosis and was also proved to be an independent prognostic factor. The expression of XIAP showed an inverse relationship with cleaved caspase-3. In addition, the expression of XAF1 and Smac/DIABLO had a positive relationship with cleaved caspase-3. These findings are consistent with their known functions, and they may help to identify individuals best suited for apoptosis-targeted therapy as a baseline data in gastric carcinoma.

            "The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) are foundational resources in cancer research, providing extensive molecular and phenotypic data. However, large-scale proteomic data across various cancer types for these cohorts remain limited. Here, we expand upon our previous work to generate high-quality protein expression data for approximately 8,000 TCGA patient samples and around 900 CCLE cell line samples, covering 447 clinically relevant proteins, using reverse-phase protein arrays. These protein expression profiles offer profound insights into intertumor heterogeneity and cancer dependency and serve as sensitive functional readouts for somatic alterations. We develop a systematic protein-centered strategy for identifying synthetic lethality pairs and experimentally validate an interaction between protein kinase A subunit \u03b1 and epidermal growth factor receptor. We also identify metastasis-related protein markers with clinical relevance. This dataset represents a valuable resource for advancing our understanding of cancer mechanisms, discovering protein biomarkers and developing innovative therapeutic strategies. \u00a9 2024.

Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is characterized by in-frame fusion of DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member B1 (DNAJB1) with protein kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit \u03b1 (PRKACA) and by dense desmoplasia. Surgery is the only effective treatment because mechanisms supporting tumor survival are unknown. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize a patient-derived FLC xenograft model and identify therapeutic targets. Human FLC cells segregated into four discrete clusters that all expressed the oncogene Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1). The two communities most enriched with cells coexpressing FLC markers [CD68, A-kinase anchoring protein 12 (AKAP12), cytokeratin 7, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM), and carbamoyl palmitate synthase-1] also had the most cells expressing YAP1 and its proproliferative target genes (AREG and CCND1), suggesting these were proliferative FLC cell clusters. The other two clusters were enriched with cells expressing profibrotic YAP1 target genes, ACTA2, ELN, and COL1A1, indicating these were fibrogenic FLC cells. All clusters expressed the YAP1 target gene and mesothelial progenitor marker mesothelin, and many mesothelin-positive cells coexpressed albumin. Trajectory analysis predicted that the four FLC communities were derived from a single cell type transitioning among phenotypic states. After establishing a novel FLC cell line that harbored the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion, YAP1 was inhibited, which significantly reduced expression of known YAP1 target genes as well as cell growth and migration. Thus, both FLC epithelial and stromal cells appear to arise from DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion in a YAP1-dependent liver mesothelial progenitor, identifying YAP1 as a target for FLC therapy. Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare liver cancer occurring predominantly in adolescent and young adult patients with no history of liver injury.1 This is in marked contrast to the much more common hepatocellular carcinoma, which arises mainly in older adults with chronically injured livers, particularly patients with advanced fibrosis or established cirrhosis. FLC is strongly associated with a specific chromosomal microdeletion that\n",

Upon massive DNA damage cells fail to undergo productive DNA repair and trigger the cell death response. Resistance to cell death is linked to cellular transformation and carcinogenesis as well as radio- and chemoresistance, making the underlying signaling pathways a promising target for therapeutic intervention. Diverse DNA damage-induced cell death pathways are operative in mammalian cells and finally culminate in the induction of programmed cell death via activation of apoptosis or necroptosis. These signaling routes affect nuclear, mitochondria- and plasma membrane-associated key molecules to activate the apoptotic or necroptotic response. In this review, we highlight the main signaling pathways, molecular players and mechanisms guiding the DNA damage-induced cell death response.

Metabolic by-products such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) stemming from the mitochondrial respiratory chain are presumably the most frequent intrinsic source of DNA damage. Naturally occurring DNA damage counts for up to 200,000 lesions per cell per day [1]. Extrinsic or environmental sources of DNA damage include ultraviolet (UV) light, ionizing radiation (IR) and exposure to genotoxic agents such as chemotherapeutic drugs. For example, UV light from the sun can induce up to 100,000 DNA lesions per cell per day (mainly pyrimidine dimers and 6\u20134 photoproducts) [2, 3]. Given the constant challenge of DNA lesions, cells had to evolve a molecular toolbox to appropriately handle the damage. This toolbox has been coined DNA damage response (DDR) and is a complex signaling network composed of versatile sensing, signal transduction and execution systems. Mildly damaged cells may repair the DNA lesions and recover. However, if the damage is irreparable, cells can ultimately trigger the cell death response to eliminate damaged, potentially threatening cells. To do so, mammalian cells have evolved a number of signaling pathways and me\n",

            "Primary liver cancer (PLC), which includes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), remains a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Chronic liver diseases, such as hepatitis B and C infections and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), are key risk factors for PLC. Metabolic reprogramming, a defining feature of cancer, enables liver cancer cells to adapt to the demands of rapid proliferation and the challenging tumor microenvironment (TME). This manuscript examines the pivotal role of metabolic reprogramming in PLC, with an emphasis on the alterations in glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism that drive tumor progression. The Warburg effect, marked by increased glycolysis, facilitates rapid energy production and biosynthesis of cellular components in HCC. Changes in lipid metabolism, including elevated de novo fatty acid synthesis and lipid oxidation, support membrane formation and energy storage essential for cancer cell survival. Amino acid metabolism, particularly glutamine utilization, supplies critical carbon and nitrogen for nucleotide synthesis and maintains redox homeostasis. These metabolic adaptations not only enhance tumor growth and invasion but also reshape the TME, promoting immune escape. Targeting these metabolic pathways presents promising therapeutic opportunities for PLC. This review underscores the interaction between metabolic reprogramming and tumor immunity, suggesting potential metabolic targets for innovative therapeutic strategies. A comprehensive understanding of PLC\u2019s intricate metabolic landscape may lead to more effective treatments and better patient outcomes. Integrating metabolomics, genomics, and proteomics in future research will be vital for identifying precise therapeutic targets and advancing personalized therapies for liver cancer. Primary liver cancer (PLC), encompassing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), is among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. In 2022, liver cancer accounted for over 750,000 fatalities worldwide, making it the third most common cause of cancer mortality, following lung and colorectal cancers, and the sixth most diagnosed malignancy. It ranks as the second deadliest cancer in men, with incidence and mortality rates in men being two to three times higher than in women\n",

            "Primary liver cancer (PLC) is the fourth most frequent cause of cancer-related death. The high mortality rates arise from late diagnosis and the limited accuracy of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. The liver is a major regulator, orchestrating the clearance of toxins, balancing glucose, lipid and amino acid uptake, managing whole-body metabolism and maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Tumour onset and progression is frequently accompanied by rearrangements of metabolic pathways, leading to dysregulation of metabolism. The limitation of current therapies targeting PLCs, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, points towards the importance of deciphering this metabolic complexity. In this Review, we discuss the role of metabolic liver disruptions and the implications of these processes in PLCs, emphasizing their clinical relevance and value in early diagnosis and prognosis and as putative therapeutic targets. We also describe system biology approaches able to reconstruct the metabolic complexity of liver diseases. We also discuss whether metabolic rearrangements are a cause or consequence of PLCs, emphasizing the opportunity to clinically exploit the rewired metabolism. In line with this idea, we discuss circulating metabolites as promising biomarkers for PLCs. The heterogeneous mutational landscape of primary liver cancers (PLCs) is associated with unique metabolic dysregulations. Substantial metabolic rearrangements are present in chronic liver diseases and contribute to the development of PLCs. Genome-wide metabolic models are useful tools to tackle the complexity of PLC metabolism. Metabolomics in different biological fluids (liquid biopsy samples) have excellent translational potential for the diagnosis of liver diseases and PLCs. Targeting metabolic rearrangements in chronic liver diseases and PLCs offers unexploited preventative and therapeutic opportunities.

Proteins are essential to life, with structural, metabolic, transport, immune, signaling and regulatory functions among many other roles.1 The term \u201cproteome\u201d was coined by an Australian PhD student, Marc Wilkins, in a 1994 symposium held in Siena, Italy.2 It is a blanket term that refers to all of the proteins that an organism can express. Each species has its own, unique proteome. Unlike the genome (the complete set of genes within each organism), the composition of the proteome is in a constant state of flux over time and throughout the organism.3 Therefore, when scientists refer to the proteome, they are also sometimes referring to the proteome at a given point in time (such as the embryo versus the mature organism), or to the proteome of a particular cell type or tissue within the organism.

The first experiments that fit the label of \u201cproteomic\u201d studies were performed in 1975 with the development of 2D protein electrophoresis.5 However, truly high-throughput identification of multiple proteins per sample only became possible with the development of mass spectrometry \n",

            "Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a rare liver cancer that is driven by the fusion of DNAJB1 and PRKACA, the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA activity is controlled through regulatory proteins that both inhibit catalytic activity and control localization, and an excess of regulatory subunits ensures PRKACA activity is inhibited. Here, we found an increase in the ratio of catalytic to regulatory units in FLC patient tumors driven by DNAJB1::PRKACA using mass spectrometry, biochemistry, and immunofluorescence, with increased nuclear localization of the kinase. Overexpression of DNAJB1::PRKACA, ATP1B1::PRKACA, or PRKACA, but not catalytically inactive kinase, caused similar transcriptomic changes in primary human hepatocytes, recapitulating the changes observed in FLC. Consistently, tumors in patients missing a regulatory subunit or harboring an ATP1B1::PRKACA fusion were indistinguishable from FLC based on the histopathological, transcriptomic, and drug-response profiles. Together, these findings indicate that the DNAJB1 domain of DNAJB1::PRKACA is not required for FLC. Instead, changes in PKA activity and localization determine the FLC phenotype. Significance: Alterations leading to unconstrained protein kinase A signaling, regardless of the presence or absence of PRKACA fusions, drive the phenotypes of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma, reshaping understanding of the pathogenesis of this rare liver cancer. \u00a92024 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.

            "Using 11 proteomics datasets, mostly available through the PRIDE database, we assembled a reference expression map for 191 cancer cell lines and 246 clinical tumour samples, across 13 lineages. We found unique peptides identified only in tumour samples despite a much higher coverage in cell lines. These were mainly mapped to proteins related to regulation of signalling receptor activity. Correlations between baseline expression in cell lines and tumours were calculated. We found these to be highly similar across all samples with most similarity found within a given sample type. Integration of proteomics and transcriptomics data showed median correlation across cell lines to be 0.58 (range between 0.43 and 0.66). Additionally, in agreement with previous studies, variation in mRNA levels was often a poor predictor of changes in protein abundance. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first meta-analysis focusing on cancer-related public proteomics datasets. We therefore also highlight shortcomings and limitations of such studies. All data is available through PRIDE dataset identifier PXD013455 and in Expression Atlas. Cancer cell lines are powerful models often used in place of primary cells to study for instance the molecular mechanisms of the disease. Cell lines derived from patients provide an inexpensive source of pure cell populations and are easy to manipulate and characterize. Although they usually retain driver mutations, cell lines often contain \u2018additional\u2019 genomic aberrations not present in tumours. They also lack the tumour microenvironment interactions and can undergo divergent evolution during long-term cell culture1,2,3. Hence, in order to capture the patient\u2019s tumour biology, it is therefore often more desirable to study primary cells or tissue biopsies. Thanks to a number of International initiatives and large-scale studies, a variety of omics approaches have been employed to characterise both tumour samples and cell lines at the molecular level. Among them, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) used next-generation sequencing (NGS) and reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPAs) to generate genome and expression landscapes in approximately 10,000 tumour specimens4, and contains over 20,000 samples in total.

            "Cell lines are extensively used tools, therefore a comprehensive proteomic overview of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and an extensive spectral library for data independent acquisition (DIA) quantification are necessary. Here, we present the proteome of nine commonly used HCC cell lines covering 9,208 protein groups, and the HCC spectral library containing 253,921 precursors, 168,811 peptides and 10,098 protein groups. The proteomic overview reveals the heterogeneity between different cell lines, and the similarity in proliferation and metastasis characteristics and drug targets-expression with tumour tissues. The HCC spectral library generating consumed 108 hours\u2019 runtime for data dependent acquisition (DDA) of 48 runs, 24 hours\u2019 runtime for database searching by MaxQuant version 2.0.3.0, and 1 hour\u2019 runtime for processing by SpectronautTM version 15.2. The HCC spectral library supports quantification of 7,637 protein groups of triples 2-hour DIA analysis of HepG2 and discovering biological alteration.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents approximately 90% of all primary liver cancer2. Studies on the proteomic landscape of HCC have advanced our knowledge at the molecular basis.

            "Despite the recent introduction of new effective systemic agents, the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at advanced stages remains dismal. This underscores the need for new therapies, which has spurred extensive research on the identification of the main drivers of pathway de-regulation as a source of novel therapeutic targets. Frequently altered pathways in HCC involve growth factor receptors (e.g., VEGFR, FGFR, TGFA, EGFR, IGFR) and/or its cytoplasmic intermediates (e.g., PI3K-AKT-mTOR, RAF/ERK/MAPK) as well as key pathways in cell differentiation (e.g., Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, JAK/STAT, Hippo, Hedgehog, Notch). Somatic mutations, chromosomal aberrations and epigenetic changes are common mechanisms for pathway deregulation in HCC. Aberrant pathway activation has also been explored as a biomarker to predict response to specific therapies, but currently, these strategies are not implemented when deciding systemic therapies in HCC patients. Beyond the well-established molecular cascades, there are numerous emerging signaling pathways also deregulated in HCC (e.g., tumor microenvironment, non-coding RNA, intestinal microbiota), which have opened new avenues for therapeutic exploration.

            "Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a rare subtype of liver cancer occurring mostly in children and young adults. We have shown that FLC comprises two separate entities: pure (p-FLC) and mixed-FLC (m-FLC), differing in clinical presentation and course. We show that p-FLCs have a distinct gene expression signature different from that of m-FLCs, which have a signature similar to that of classical hepatocellular carcinomas. We found p-FLC profiles to be unique among 263 profiles related to diverse tumoral and nontumoral liver samples. We identified two distinct molecular subgroups of p-FLCs with different outcomes. Pathway analysis of p-FLCs revealed ERBB2 overexpression and an up-regulation of glycolysis, possibly leading to compensatory mitochondrial hyperplasia and oncocytic differentiation. Four of the sixteen genes most significantly overexpressed in p-FLCs were neuroendocrine genes: prohormone convertase 1 (PCSK1); neurotensin; delta/notch-like EGF repeat containing; and calcitonin. PCSK1 overexpression was validated by immunohistochemistry, yielding specific, diffuse staining of the protein throughout the cytoplasm, possibly corresponding to a functional form of this convertase. Conclusion: p-FLCs have a unique transcriptomic signature characterized by the strong expression of specific neuroendocrine genes, suggesting that these tumors may have a cellular origin different from that of HCC. Our data have implications for the use of genomic profiling for diagnosis and selection of targeted therapies in patients with p-FLC. \u00a9 2014 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

Oncogenic KRAS mutations rewire cellular signaling, leading to significant alterations in gene expression. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a pivotal role in gene expression regulation by post-transcriptionally controlling various aspects of RNA metabolism. It has become clear that interactions between RBPs and RNA are frequently dysregulated in numerous cancers. However, how oncogenic KRAS mutations reshape the post-transcriptional regulatory network mediated by RBPs remains poorly understood. In this study, we systematically dissected oncogenic KRAS-driven alterations of RNA-RBP networks. We identified 35 cancer-associated RBPs with either increased or decreased RNA binding upon oncogenic KRAS activation, including PDCD11, which is essential for the viability of KRAS mutant cancers, and ELAVL2, which regulates cell migration in KRAS mutant lung cancers. Our study serves as a crucial resource for elucidating RBP regulatory networks in KRAS mutant cancers and may provide new avenues for therapeutic strategies targeting KRAS mutant malignancies.

            "Unfolded protein response (UPR) is the mechanism by which cells control endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein homeostasis. ER proteostasis is essential to adapt to cell proliferation and regeneration in development and tumorigenesis, but mechanisms linking UPR, growth control, and cancer progression remain unclear. Here, we report that the Ire1/Xbp1s pathway has surprisingly oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles in a context-dependent manner. Activation of Ire1/Xbp1s up-regulates their downstream target Bip, which sequesters Yorkie (Yki), a Hippo pathway transducer, in the cytoplasm to restrict Yki transcriptional output. This regulation provides an endogenous defensive mechanism in organ size control, intestinal homeostasis, and regeneration. Unexpectedly, Xbp1 ablation promotes tumor overgrowth but suppresses invasiveness in a Drosophila cancer model. Mechanistically, hyperactivated Ire1/Xbp1s signaling in turn induces JNK-dependent developmental and oncogenic cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via repression of Yki. In humans, a negative correlation between XBP1 and YAP (Yki ortholog) target gene expression specifically exists in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), and those with high XBP1 or HSPA5 (Bip ortholog) expression have better clinical outcomes. In human TNBC cell lines and xenograft models, ectopic XBP1s or HSPA5 expression alleviates tumor growth but aggravates cell migration and invasion. These findings uncover a conserved crosstalk between the Ire1/Xbp1s and Hippo signaling pathways under physiological settings, as well as a crucial role of Bip-Yki interaction in tumorigenesis that is shared from Drosophila to humans.

            "Corresponding author. Issue date 2012 Oct. Functional genomic screens apply knowledge gained from the sequencing of the human genome toward rapid methods of identifying genes involved in cellular function based on a specific phenotype. This approach has been made possible through the use of advances in both molecular biology and automation. The utility of this approach has been further enhanced through the application of image-based high content screening, an automated microscopy and quantitative image analysis platform. These approaches can significantly enhance acquisition of novel targets for drug discovery. Both the utility and potential issues associated with functional genomic screening approaches are discussed along with examples that illustrate both. The considerations for high content screening applied to functional genomics are also presented. Functional genomic and high content screening are extremely useful in the identification of new drug targets. However, the technical, experimental, and computational parameters have an enormous influence on the results. Thus, although new targets are identified, caution should be applied toward interpretation of screening data in isolation. Genomic screens should be viewed as an integral component of a target identification campaign that requires both the acquisition of orthogonal data, as well as a rigorous validation strategy. Keywords: Genome-wide siRNA screening, High content screening, Target identification, Target deconvolution In order to identify the cause and possible treatment of human disease, it is critical to understand the underlying genes, proteins and processes involved in its etiology. Until modern molecular technologies became generally available, genes and their function were generally defined using classical genetics, an approach that requires alternate phenotypes that segregate in genetic crosses. Frequently, model organisms were necessary in order to perform the mutagenesis required to alter or abrogate gene function. Using these laborious systems, many genes of interest have been identified and exploited. However, with the sequencing of the human genome and the advent of a wide variety of new molecular tools, the entire paradigm of genetic analysis has changed enabling the application of \u2018reverse genetics\u2019.

A generalized therapeutic strategy for various disease conditions, including cancer, is to deplete or inactivate harmful protein targets. Various forms of protein or gene silencing molecules, e.g., small molecule inhibitors, RNA interference (RNAi), and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been used against druggable targets. Over the past few years, targeted protein degradation (TPD) approaches have been developed for direct degradation of candidate proteins. Among the TPD approaches, proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have emerged as one of the most promising approaches for the selective elimination of proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Other than PROTACs, TPD methods with potential therapeutic use include intrabody-mediated protein knockdown and tripartite motif-21 (TRIM-21) mediated TRIM-Away. In this review, protein knockdown approaches, their modes of action, and their advantages over conventional gene knockdown approaches are summarized. In cancers, disease-associated protein functions are often executed by specific post-translational modifications (PTMs). The role of TRIM-Away is highlighted in the direct knockdown of PTM forms of target proteins. Moreover, the application challenges and the prospective clinical use of TPD approaches in various diseases are also discussed. Keywords: Protein knockdown, post-translational modification, proteolysis targeting chimeras, intrabodies, tripartite motif-21, cancer Proteins execute nearly all the functions in a living cell. Consequently, protein dysfunction leads to the development of various disease conditions, including neurological and immunological disorders, and cancer. Thus, approa\n",

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Background and Objectives: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of primary liver cancer, is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. It arises and progresses against fibrotic or cirrhotic backgrounds mainly due to infection with hepatitis viruses B (HBV) or C (HCV) or non-viral causes that lead to chronic inflammation and genomic changes. A better understanding of molecular and immune mechanisms in HCC subtypes is needed. Materials and Methods: To identify transcriptional changes in primary HCC tumors with or without hepatitis viral etiology, we analyzed the transcriptomes of 24 patients by next-generation sequencing. Results: We identified common and unique differentially expressed genes for each etiological tumor group and analyzed the expression of SLC, ATP binding cassette, cytochrome 450, cancer testis, and heat shock protein genes. Metascape functional enrichment analysis showed mainly upregulated cell-cycle pathways in HBV and HCV and upregulated cell response to stress in non-viral infection. GeneWalk analysis identified regulator, hub, and moonlighting genes and highlighted CCNB1, ACTN2, BRCA1, IGF1, CDK1, AURKA, AURKB, and TOP2A in the HCV group and HSF1, HSPA1A, HSP90AA1, HSPB1, HSPA5, PTK2, and AURKB in the group without viral infection as hub genes. Immune infiltrate analysis showed that T cell, cytotoxic, and natural killer cell markers were significantly more highly expressed in HCV than in non-viral tumors. Genes associated with monocyte activation had the highest expression levels in HBV, while high expression of genes involved in primary adaptive immune response and complement receptor activity characterized tumors without viral infection. Conclusions: Our comprehensive study underlines the high degree of complexity of immune profiles in the analyzed groups, which adds to the heterogeneous HCC genomic landscape. The biomarkers identified in each HCC group might serve as therapeutic targets. Keywords: hepatocellular carcinoma, HBV, HCV, RNA-seq, immune infiltrate, biomarkers Liver cancer is the \n",

            "The identification and validation of drug targets are crucial in biomedical research and many studies have been conducted on analyzing drug target features for getting a better understanding on principles of their mechanisms. But most of them are based on either strong biological hypotheses or the chemical and physical properties of those targets separately. In this paper, we investigated three main ways to understand the functional biomolecules based on the topological features of drug targets. There are no significant differences between targets and common proteins in the protein-protein interactions network, indicating the drug targets are neither hub proteins which are dominant nor the bridge proteins. According to some special topological structures of the drug targets, there are significant differences between known targets and other proteins. Furthermore, the drug targets mainly belong to three typical communities based on their modularity. These topological features are helpful to understand how the drug targets work in the PPI network. Particularly, it is an alternative way to predict potential targets or extract nontargets to test a new drug target efficiently and economically. By this way, a drug target's homologue set containing 102 potential target proteins is predicted in the paper.

Although driver genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been investigated in various previous genetic studies, prevalence of key driver genes among heterogeneous populations is unknown. Moreover, the phenotypic associations of these driver genes are poorly understood. This report aims to reveal the phenotypic impacts of a group of consensus driver genes in HCC. We used MutSigCV and OncodriveFM modules implemented in the IntOGen pipeline to identify consensus driver genes across six HCC cohorts comprising 1,494 samples in total. To access their global impacts, we used TCGA mutations and copy number variations to predict the transcriptomics data, under generalized linear models. We further investigated the associations of the consensus driver genes to patient survival, age, gender, race and risk factors. We identify 10 consensus driver genes across six HCC cohorts in total. Integrative analysis of driver mutations, copy number variations and transcriptomic data reveals that these consensus driver mutations and their copy number variations are associated with majority (62.5%) of the mRNA transcriptome, but only a small fraction (8.9%) of miRNAs. Genes associated with TP53, CTNNB1, and ARID1A mutations contribute to the tripod of most densely connected pathway clusters. These driver genes are significantly associated with patients\u2019 overall survival. Some driver genes are significantly linked to HCC gender (CTNNB1, ALB, TP53 and AXIN1), race (TP53 and CDKN2A), and age (RB1) disparities. This study prioritizes a group of consensus drivers in HCC, which collectively show vast impacts on the phenotypes. These driver genes may warrant as valuable therapeutic targets of HCC.
